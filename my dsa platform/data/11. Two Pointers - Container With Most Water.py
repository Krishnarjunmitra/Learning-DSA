Problem: Container With Most Water
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
