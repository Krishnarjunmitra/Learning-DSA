Problem: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. Given the rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
