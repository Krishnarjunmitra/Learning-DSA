Problem: Merge k Sorted Lists
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Example 1:
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]

Example 2:
Input: lists = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
