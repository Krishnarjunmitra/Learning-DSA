Problem: Longest Common Subsequence
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

Example 1:
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
