Problem: Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
